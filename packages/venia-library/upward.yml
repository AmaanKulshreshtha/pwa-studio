# This is the UPWARD definition *partial* for the Venia library.
# IT IS NOT A COMPLETE, VALID UPWARD FILE.
# It is meant to be **merged** into the final upward.yml of a Buildpack PWA,
# using the plugin "UpwardIncludePlugin".
# The final, compiled upward.yml file must have top-level `status`, `headers`,
# and `body` properties.
# To use the logic provided by @magento/venia-library, you would set the
# following properties in your app's upward.yml file:
#
# status: veniaResponse.status
# headers: veniaResponse.headers
# body: veniaResponse.body

# This is a top-level object used to set values for the root `status`,
# `headers`, and `body` properties.
# It is the first branch in an abstract decision tree, which ultimately
# resolves to an object that contains values for its own 'status', 'headers',
# and 'body' properties.
# This object uses a ConditionalResolver to determine the object value based
# on the URL pattern in the request object.
